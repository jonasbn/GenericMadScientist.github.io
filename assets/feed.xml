      When I made this blog I envisioned myself talking about how other people’s
programs work. However, I’ve had plenty of people ask me how my own program
CHOpt works, so today I’m going to talk about that.

As a quick note, I’m not going to go over my specific classes and functions
because that would be boring and then I’d potentially have to update this.
Instead I will go over the algorithm in br...

      Alternative title: how to be passive aggressive with asterisks.

Overview

In Pokémon Stadium 2 the vast majority of battles have you and your opponent
bring a team of six. From there, both sides choose a subset of three to bring.
This post is on how the game decides which subset of three to bring and my
descent into madness brought about by trying to understand the implications of
all the mist...

      It’s been a while, hasn’t it? I did have plans for having my next post be on
Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2, but then I decided that to do
that as well as I wanted I would first have to do one on
Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3 and I quickly lost interest during my
playthrough of that.

But enough excuses! Today we’re going to dive into
Pokémon Stadium 2’s Challenge Cup mode. For the sake of

      This is the third and final post I plan to do on
Yu-Gi-Oh! Nightmare Troubadour. I may come back to it at
a later date, but for now I’ve worked out everything I really wanted to know.
Like the previous two posts, this work was done with the PAL version of the
game. I did check the trades in the NTSC-U version as well just to make sure on
Imperial Order, though.

I’m not the first one to look in...

      In the previous post we looked at the details of how packs work
in Yu-Gi-Oh! Nightmare Troubadour. In this post we’re
going to look at how the game decides which NPCs to spawn, and a little about
how the game places them on the map. Like the last post, this work was done on
the PAL version of the game. I did have a quick peek at the corresponding data
for the NTSC-U version though, because of t...
